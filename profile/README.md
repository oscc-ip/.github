## Hi, OSCC IP Project ðŸ‘‹

OSCC IP Project contains a bundle of IPs which aim to improve development experience of processor and SoC design. Now it mainly focus on frontend and verification field. We hope it can be integrated by other components to build a common workflow for agile hardware development from frontend to backend one day.

## Motivation

The IPs List:

| Type | List |
| :---: | :---: |
| System     | uart, spi-flash, amba bus, dma, trace, clint, plic, jtag, rcu, pmu, core, archinfo |
| Peripheral | timer, rtc, watchdog, pwm, gpio, ps2, spi, qspi, octspi, i2c, i2s, sdio |
| Memory     | sram, sdram, psram, nand-flash, ddr1, ddr2, ddr3, chiplink |
| Graphics   | vga, hdmi, mipi-dsi, video engine, gpu |
| Communication | usb, ethernet, pcie |
| Application | crc, aes, foc, cnn |
